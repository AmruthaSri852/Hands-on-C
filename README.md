# Hands-on-C
Many have their great experiences of coding rooted with C programming, If you are one of them, So am I.

### Major Focus: 
    1. Neat code in the best possible ways
    2. New approaches to tackle the code
    3. projecting the method of working
    4. Learning.queries.repeat
### Why Hands-on-C:
    For me C programming, is basic to understand all complex codes dumped in many languages 
    Learning C helped me alot in improvizing my technical knowlegde. 
    Now after C I don't feel worried seeing a complex code cuz' of the experience maybe Idk but 
    I don't want to lose this wonderful experience so filing it up here.
